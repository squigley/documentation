TrueCommand is incredibly versatile and offers several different install options.
TrueCommand Cloud is the preferred method for using TrueCommand, as this option requires no local resources or specific hardware requirements to get started!

## Install Options

Click one of the tabs below to see instructions for your preferred deployment method.

{{< tabs "TrueCommand Install Options" >}}
{{< tab "VM Deployment" >}}

Deploying TrueCommand on a virtual machine (VM) requires different methods depending on what operating system you intend to use. 

You can find VM images and setup instructions on our [TrueCommand-install](https://github.com/ixsystems/truecommand-install) GitHub repository.

## Linux

### Debian

If you don't already have it, you can download the VM image [here](https://www.debian.org/CD/http-ftp/).

{{< hint info >}}
Ensure you have the "wget" utility installed first: `apt-get install wget`
{{< /hint >}}

Run this command (as root) from a system terminal:  
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iXsystems/truecommand-install/main/debian/setup.sh -O - | bash`

### Alpine

If you don't already have it, you can download the VM image [here](https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/).

{{< hint info >}}
Ensure you have the "wget" utility installed first: `apk add wget`.   
Ensure that you have the "community" package repository enabled:
* Edit the */etc/apk/repositories* file as root and uncomment the community repository line.
* Run `apk update` to refresh the list of available packages.
{{< /hint >}}

Run this command (as root) from a system terminal:   
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iXsystems/truecommand-install/main/alpine/setup.sh -O - | sh`

### Void

If you don't already have it, you can download the VM image [here](https://voidlinux.org/download/).

{{< hint info >}}
Ensure you have the "wget" utility installed first: `xbps-install -y wget`
{{< /hint >}}

Run this command (as root) from a system terminal:   
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iXsystems/truecommand-install/main/void/setup.sh -O - | bash`

## Windows

If you don't already have it, you can download the VM image [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10).

1. On your Windows platform (VM or Bare-Metal) install [Docker for Windows](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows/).
2. Open Windows PowerShell (**Start > Windows Power Shell > Windows Power Shell**)
3. Run the following command inside powershell to start TrueCommand:   
`docker run --pull=always --restart unless-stopped --detach -v "[hostdirectory]:/data" -p [portnumber]:80 -p [sslportnumber]:443 ixsystems/truecommand`

{{< hint info >}}
Replace *[hostdirectory]* with a path to where you want TrueCommand to store its local database. Replace *[portnumber]* and *[sslportnumber]* with the ports you wish to expose for TC access.
{{< /hint >}}

If the command was successful, you should be able to access TrueCommand on *http://localhost:80*.
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Cloud Deployment" >}}

## Installing the TrueCommand Container

{{< hint warning >}}
Docker Desktop for Windows uses Hyper-V.
This interferes with other virtualization applications.
For example, Docker Desktop and VMware Workstation Player cannot simultaneously run.
{{< /hint >}}

Before fetching the TrueCommand docker image, create a local directory.
Enter `mkdir {DIRECTORY}`, where *{DIRECTORY}* is the new name.

After creating the new directory, fetch and run the TrueCommand Docker image.
Open a Command Line Interface (CLI) and enter `docker run \--detach -v "/{HOSTDIR}:/data" -p {PORT}:80 -p
{SSL}:443 ixsystems/truecommand:latest`.
*{HOSTDIR}* is a directory on the host machine for Docker container data, *{PORT}* is the TrueCommand web interface port number, and *{SSL}* port number for secure web interface access.

To install the container with an earlier TrueCommand release, replace `latest` with the desired TrueCommand version tag:
```
docker run \--detach -v "/DockerDir:/data" -p 9004:80 -p 9005:443 ixsystems/truecommand:1.3.2
```

{{< hint info >}}
Use [Windows compatible syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/io/file-path-formats) when specifying paths in the Windows file system.
For example, if the created directory for the TrueCommand image was created in the Windows <file>Documents</file> folder, the `docker` command would be:
`docker run \--detach -v C:\Users\\Example\\Documents\\DockerDir`.
In this command *C* is the drive letter, *Example* is the current user name, and *DockerDir* is the TrueCommand image directory.
{{< /hint >}}

Although there are different ways to run a Docker container, `-v /*hostdirectory*:/data` is required for TrueCommand to function.

{{< hint warning >}}
Do not try to use the same `hostdirectory` for two different containers!
This results in file conflicts and database corruption.
{{< /hint >}}

## Accessing the TrueCommand Web Interface

After fetching the TrueCommand Docker container, enter `docker ps` to see details about running containers.

![DockerContainerList](/images/TrueCommand/DockerContainerList.png "Finding the TrueCommand Container")

Use the port assigned to the container to access the web interface.
The list from `docker ps` contains a *PORTS* column.
Find the port associated with the `ixsystems/truecommand:latest` *IMAGE*.
The *PORTS* entry is listed as `0.0.0.0:port->80/tcp`, `0.0.0.0:sslport->443/tcp` where `port` and `sslport` are the ports specified earlier.

To access the web interface with no encryption, enter `hostsystemIPaddress:port` in a browser address bar, where `hostsystemIPaddress` is the IP address of the host system that is running the TrueCommand Docker container.
To access the web interface with standard SSL encryption, enter `https://hostsystemIPaddress:sslport` in a browser address bar.

{{< expand "The connection can't be established?" "v" >}}
When a connection to the web interface cannot be established, add the container ports as an exception to the host system firewall.
{{< /expand >}}
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Docker Desktop (Windows)" >}}
The requirements to run TrueCommand in Docker Desktop for Windows are:

* Windows 10 Enterprise, Pro, or Education editions.
* 64-bit Processor with Second Level Address Translation (SLAT).
* CPU support for VM Monitor Mode Extension (VT-c on Intel CPUs).
* Hyper-V is enabled in Windows 10.
* 4 GB memory at minimum.
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) needs to be installed in Windows.

### Enable Hyper-V

To enable Hyper-V, click on Windows Start button and select or search for *Apps & Features*.
Select *Programs and Features* under **Related settings** and *Turn Windows Features on or off* (Administrator action).
Set the Hyper-V option and click *Ok*.
 You will need to restart your restart your computer for the change to take effect.

![EnableHyperV](/images/TrueCommand/EnableHyperV.png "Enable HyperV")

Alternatively, Hyper-V can be enabled with the **Powershell**.
To do this, run Powershell as a Windows Administrator and enter `Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All`.
If an error is returned that says the command could not be found, verify that you are running PowerShell as the Administrator.
After the command successfully runs, reboot the computer.

![PowershellHyperVCLI](/images/TrueCommand/PowershellHyperVCLI.png "Powershell HyperV CLI")

### Install Docker Desktop

Open Docker Hub and click *[Get Docker](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows/)*.

![DownloadDockerDesktop](/images/TrueCommand/DownloadDockerDesktop.png "Download Docker Desktop")

Run the installer after the download completes.
When the installer is finished, reboot the system.

{{< expand "Different Admin accounts?" "v" >}}
If the admin account is different from your Windows user account, the user must be added to the `docker-users` group.
Run *Computer Management* as an administrator and go to **Local Users and Groups > Groups > docker-users** to add the user to the group.
Changes take effect after logging out and back in.
{{< /expand >}}

{{< expand "WSL 2 Install Incomplete?" "v" >}}
If this error message appears after rebooting, install the Linux Kernel Update Package:

![DockerDesktopError](/images/TrueCommand/DockerDesktopError.png "Docker Desktop Error")

The update package is downloaded from a [Windows storage location](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi).

![DockerDesktopInstallWSL](/images/TrueCommand/DockerDesktopInstallWSL.png "Docker Desktop Install WSL")

Microsoft has additional documentation available for assistance with [downloading the Linux kernel update](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package).

After installing the kernel update, set the WSL default version to `version 2` by opening the Powershell and entering `wsl --set-default-version 2`.

![DockerDesktopSetWSLDefault](/images/TrueCommand/DockerDesktopSetWSLDefault.png "Docker Desktop Set WSL Default")

The system must be rebooted after changing the default version.
{{< /expand >}}

## Installing the TrueCommand Docker Container

Open the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) in a browser and search for `ixsystems/truecommand`.

![DockerHubSearchResults](/images/TrueCommand/DockerHubSearchResults.png "Finding the TrueCommand Container")

![DockerHubTrueCommand](/images/TrueCommand/DockerHubTrueCommand.png "TrueCommand Container details")

Verify the pull command required and run it from a command line. Example: `docker pull ixsystems/truecommand:latest`.

![DockerHubCLIInstallTrueCommand](/images/TrueCommand/DockerHubCLIInstallTrueCommand.png "CLI: Install TrueCommand Container")

When the container is downloaded, open the Docker Desktop and select *Images*.
Hover over the *ixsystems/truecommand* entry to show the **Run** button, then click it.

![DockerDesktopImages](/images/TrueCommand/DockerDesktopImages.png "Docker Desktop: Starting the TrueCommand Container")

Open the *Optional Settings* drop down menu, name the container, and set the following port values.
Investigate your network environment or check with your IT department to ensure that these ports will not conflict with any other running services.

* Local Host Port: `9005`
* Container Port `443`

Click the `+` sign to add a second set of ports.

* Local Host Port `9004`
* Container Port `80/tcp`

![DockerDesktopTrueCommandConfig](/images/TrueCommand/DockerDesktopTrueCommandConfig.png "")

Setting the **Volume** is not usually required for TrueCommand.
Click *RUN* after configuring the settings.

When Docker Desktop shows the container status as **RUNNING**, open a new browser tab and go to `https://127.0.0.1:9005`.

![DockerDesktopTrueCommandRunning](/images/TrueCommand/DockerDesktopTrueCommandRunning.png "TrueCommand Container is running")

## Adding Browser Security Exceptions

TrueCommand uses a [self signed certificate](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8705) for a secure connection.
Because of this, many Internet browsers consider the IP address or DNS hostname untrustworthy.
In these cases, the IP address or DNS hostname must be added as an exception to the browser to access the web interface.
The process of adding an exception is shown here for two different browsers, but the procedure is similar for most browsers.

{{< tabs "Browser Security Exceptions" >}}
{{< tab "Chrome" >}}
Click *Advanced* to view information about the error code.
Click *Proceed to {hostname} (unsafe)*.

![ChromeWarning](/images/TrueCommand/2.0/ChromeWarning.png "Chrome Warning")
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Firefox" >}}
Click *Advanced* to view information about the error code.

![FirefoxWarning](/images/TrueCommand/2.0/FirefoxWarning.png "Firefox Warning")

Click *Add Exception...*.
Set *Permanently store this exception* to keep the IP address or DNS hostname permanently stored in Firefox.
Click *Confirm Security Exception*.
